# 📝 To-Do Task Management App

A small full-stack project built with **.NET Core (backend)**, **EF Core In-Memory/SQLite (data persistence)**, and **React (frontend)**.  

This project demonstrates:
- Clean API design with .NET Core
- Data structure design using EF Core
- Frontend component design in React
- Communication between frontend and backend
- Clean code, architecture, and documented thought process

The app provides basic task management functionality (create, list, complete, and delete tasks) and includes notes on trade-offs, assumptions, and future scalability considerations.
